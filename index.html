    <h2>1. Never buy anyone Christmas presents</h2>
    <p>Everyone knows that everybody hates presents anyway.</p>
    <p>Why not keep all that precious, sweet sweet, hard-earned CA$H $WAG MONEY DOLLAR BILL for yourself?</p>

    <h2>2. Always steal candy from children</h2>  
    <p>You're always doing them a favour really.</p>
    <p>I mean, why would you want it ruining any of their silly little teeth?</p>

    <h2>3. Chomp on some delicious tasty broken glass</h2>
    <p>Always munch on some crunch-tastic broken glass if and when you have it around. A real Christmas delicacy!</p>
    <p>Of course, there may be times when you are running short of broken glass (mmm, just the thought of this is making my mouth water!). In these instances, you have several optional replacements: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Porcelain</li>
      <li>Gravel</li>
      <li>Rocks</li>
      <li>Any metal tables or chairs</li>
      <li>The walls of next door's house</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. If All Else Fails, Open Your Heart</h2>
    <p>If all else fails and I do mean absolutely everything else under the sun then maybe you can try opening your heart up to people.</p>
    <p>But only if absolutely all else fails! Only if all of the above falls flat.</p>
    <p>Then, and only then, look around you and see if everything you have ever wanted and loved isn't right there already, in front of you.</p>
    <p>See if all the love in the world isn't already here. Now.</p>
